## Symfony

Full stack project worked in symfony where PHP is used for database actions and JS for fronted part.
Project is still not 100% finished in fronted part but I'll make updates soon.

Required: 
   
         composer install
         
## Theme

Theme of this project is quite similar as this theme that I described above in Laravel project. Every user have to log in so he can actually make something on his site(example upload something and then make all changes that he wants) and every user has control for his own posts, so no one can't even read documents posted from other users. The
biggest difference from this project and project that I did before in Laravel is that this is full stack project where I used Symfony/PHP as backend and I've done much
more things with database here then in the project before.
I used Javascript (jQuery and Ajax requests) for fronted part and all changes on fronted .
All technologies used: Symfony/PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript(jQuery/Ajax).
