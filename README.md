## Symfony

Full stack project worked in symfony where PHP is used for database actions and JS for frontend part.

Required: 
   
         composer install
         
## Theme

This projet theme is something similar to classic blog. Every user have to log in so he can actually make something on his site(example upload something and then make all changes that he wants) and every user has control for his own posts, so no one can't even read documents posted from other users. 
I used Javascript (jQuery and Ajax requests) for client/server communications.
All technologies used: Symfony/PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript/jQuery.
